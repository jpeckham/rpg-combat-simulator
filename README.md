# Palladium Rifts Combat Simulator

A C# Console Application designed to simulate combat scenarios from the **Palladium Rifts** Role-Playing Game, focusing on the *Rifts Ultimate Edition* ruleset.

## Purpose
The simulator provides a "simplistic yet 100% accurate" representation of Rifts combat mechanics, specifically handling the high-stakes interactivity of **Mega-Damage Capacity (M.D.C.)** battles, ammunition logistics, and action economy.

## Background
Rifts is known for its complex combat system involving multiple attacks per melee round, active defenses (Parry/Dodge), and distinct damage types (S.D.C. vs M.D.C.). This project simulates these interactions to verify game balance or simply watch giant robots fight.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (6.0 or later)

### Running the Simulator
1. Open a terminal in the project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\james\source\repos\palladium-rifts-combat-simulator
   ```
2. Execute the run command:
   ```powershell
   dotnet run
   ```
